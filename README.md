# AutoGetBak

Python GUI app to find and purge ```.bak``` files created by AutoCAD products. 

## Description

When working in an engineering team, that works from synced project directories, the backup files generated by 
AutoCad products can start to add up. This application is written in Python and uses the built-in tkinter GUI framework
to allow the user to choose a parent directory and quickly display a list of all located ```.bak``` files. Only files
found with a matching ```.dwg``` file will be displayed. This prevents purging dangling backups. The displayed list 
allows selecting individual files, allowing the user to selectively purge unwanted backups. 

### Dependencies
